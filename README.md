# ðŸ§¨DDoSLink Destroyer.

![DDoS](https://github.com/Wayset/DDoSLink-Destroyer/blob/main/ddoslink.png?raw=true)

 Many people are lazy to look for open ports and IPs of their victims, so I wrote this mini code for DDoS using just one link!
 We do not urge you to attack the sites of ordinary users, but rather test your sites!

Install in Linux:
```bash
apt install python3
apt install git
git clone https://github.com/Wayset/DDoSLink-Destroyer
cd DDoSLink-Destroyer
sudo python3 ddoslink.py
```

## ðŸ”©To-do:
- [ ] Optimization Code.
- [ ] Add Proxys list (and write code for proxy).
